      <h1>DNA Repair</h1>
      <!-- <hr> -->
    DNA damage by exogenous physical and chemical agents is the most common cause of cancer.  Conversely, some of the most commonly used anticancer drugs kill malignant cells by damaging their DNA.  DNA Repair is the ensemble of molecular mechanisms that eliminate DNA damage from the genome, and it plays crucial roles in carcinogenesis and in cancer therapy.  Our lab works on Nucleotide Excision Repair which is the sole pathway for repairing cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) adducts that cause cancer and cure cancer, respectively.  We discovered that these lesions are removed from DNA by dual incisions that generate 24-32 nucleotide-long oligomers (“nominal 30-mer”).  We identified and purified the 6 repair factors, RPA, XPA, XPC, TFIIH, XPG, XPF-ERCC1, that are essential for dual incisions.  Using these purified factors, we reconstituted human excision repair in vitro and defined the molecular mechanism of excision repair.  The in vitro work was complemented by in vivo studies which enabled us to generate a repair map of the entire genome.  We discovered that the nominal 30-mer is released in a tight complex with TFIIH, and this finding enabled us to isolate the nominal 30-mers from irradiated cells and subject them to deep sequencing (Fig. 1).  By using normal human fibroblasts and mutant cell lines we created repair maps for general repair and transcription-coupled repair of UV damage for the entire human genome through this method which we have named XR-seq (eXcision Repair-Sequencing).  Our future work will exploit XR-seq to uncover novel genomic regulators of excision repair of DNA damage by anti-cancer drugs with the ultimate goal of developing improved chemotherapy regimens.  In addition, we plan to investigate the effect of the excised nominal 30-mer on cellular physiology and the processing and ultimate fates of the excised oligonucleotides.

           Fig. 2. (A) Coupling Excision Repair and the ATR-mediated Checkpoint. When DNA is damaged by UV or a UV-mimetic agent, the core excision repair factors (RPA, XPA, XPC, TFIIH, XPG, XPF-ERCC1) excise a ∼30-nt oligomer containing the damage. The resulting gap is either filled in by polymerases or the gap is enlarged by EXO1. The enlarged ssDNA gap is coated with RPA, which recruits ATR-ATRIP, TopBP1, and substrates including p53. (B) Schematic of repair-checkpoint coupling in vitro. (C) Repair-checkpoint coupling Kinase reactions containing RPA as a substrate were incubated with ATR-ATRIP, TopBP1, and EXO1 as indicated.

        <h1>DNA Damage Checkpoints</h1>
   DNA Damage Checkpoints are intracellular signaling pathways that delay or arrest cell cycle progression in response to DNA damage and thus aid in preventing mutations and cellular and organismic death.  In human cells, two main DNA damage checkpoints pathways have been defined that are governed by the ATM and ATR protein kinases.  The ATR pathway is activated by UV or by replication block by base damage or by nucleotide depletion.  In line with our interest with cellular response to UV and UV-mimetic agents, we have been studying the ATR-mediated DNA damage checkpoint response using in vitro systems with purified proteins as well as cell-based assays.  Using purified proteins and model DNA substrates that mimic the initiating triggers for DNA damage checkpoint activation, we have reconstituted the bases ATR-dependent signaling reaction.  Importantly, we have succeeded in linking DNA excision repair to the ATR checkpoint pathway (Fig. 2): Using purified core nucleotide excision repair factors (RPA, XPA, XPC, TFIIH, XPG, and XPF-ERCC1), core DNA damage checkpoint proteins (ATR-ATRIP, TopBP1, RPA), and damaged DNA, we coupled excision repair to the ATR-mediated checkpoint.  We found that checkpoint signaling as measured by phosphorylation of target proteins (RPA, p53) required the enlargement of the single-strand gap generated by the excision repair system by the 5’ to 3’ exonuclease activity of EXO1 enzyme in accordance with the in vivo data.  Future work will take advantage of our unique in vitro system to characterize novel regulators of ATR signaling and to screen and validate promising anti-cancer drugs that inhibit the ATR function.

      <h1>Control of DNA Repair by the Circadian Clock</h1>
    We discovered that the circadian clock controls nucleotide excision repair in mammalian organisms.  We wish to apply this finding for cancer prevention and treatment because excision repair removes DNA damage caused by carcinogens as well as damage caused by anticancer drugs. We are using mice as the model organism for these studies.
	We found that excision repair of carcinogenic UV damage in mice is low at early morning hours and reaches its highest level in the evening. As a consequence, mice exposed to carcinogenic UVB light in morning are 4-times more likely to develop invasive skin cancer than mice exposed to the same UVB dose in the evening (Fig. 3A). These findings should have implications for the optimum time for human sun exposure.
	To determine the effect of the circadian clock on the repair of DNA damage caused by the anticancer drug cisplatin, we injected cisplatin into mice at 4 hour intervals for a period of one day and analyzed the repair of Platinum-DNA adducts over the course of the day genome-wide and at single nucleotide resolution.  We found that the repair of Pt-DNA adducts is controlled by two circadian programs in mouse tissue: (1) The clock controls transcription of 1500-2000 genes with expression maxima of different genes spread over the entire day, but with the majority peaking at pre-dawn and pre-dusk. Because transcription stimulates repair of adducts in the transcribed strand (TS), the TS of circadian-controlled genes are repaired at times of day specific for each gene with prominent peats at pre-dawn and pre-dusk (Fig. 3B). (2) The clock controls expression of the XPA protein and therefore of excision repair activity which peaks at ZT8-10 (ZT=0 is the time when light is turned on, XT=12 is the time light is turned off under 12h light: 12h dark conditions). Because the basal repair activity has rhythmicity, the repair of Pt-DNA adducts in the regions of the genome that are not transcribed (the nontranscribed strand (NTS) of transcribed genes, both strands of non-transcribed genes, and intergenic regions) peak at XT8-10. As a consequence of these two circadian programs, in many circadian-controlled genes the peak and trough repair times for TS and NTS are different, and sometimes anti-phase.
	Cisplatin is the most commonly used chemotherapeutic drug for treating solid tumors. However, the usefulness of this important drug is limited due of its toxicity and primary acquired resistance by cancer cells. Frequently, biochemical pathways of cancer cells are out of synchrony with those in normal tissues, and these are indications that the circadian clock is “broken” in cancerous tissue.  We aim to take advantage of our data regarding orderly repair in normal tissue compared to arrhythmic repair in cancer to develop cisplatin administration regiments (Chronochemotherapy) to improve the efficacy and reduce side effects of cisplatin therapy.
