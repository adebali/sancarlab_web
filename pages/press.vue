    <p>Congratulations to Dr. Xuemei Cao on her promotion to Research Associate on Sep 18, 2023. Dr. Cao joined Professor Sancar’s lab as a postdoc in 2018. She received her Ph.D. degree from the China Agricultural University in Beijing, China. Since joining the Sancar lab, Dr. Cao started to work on the mechanism of the mammalian circadian clock and DNA repair. She found cryptochromes mediate recruitment of PER-CK1 complexes to CLOCK: BMAL1, resulting in CLOCK phosphorylation and release from DNA for two types of repression by CRYs and calculate the size of circadian clock complex. Her current project is to understand the genome-wide DNA repair in test tube in a vitro system which is essential for understanding DNA repair biological function.</p>

    <p>Exposure to UV radiation triggers DNA lesions that can lead to skin cancer, the most common type of cancer in the United States. Previous studies in mice have shown that levels of a protein called XPA, involved in repairing UV-induced DNA lesions, waxes and wanes with the time of day. Shobhan Gaddameedhi et al. found that the protein's level and activity in mouse skin cells are at their lowest at 4 AM and their highest at 4PM.</p>
