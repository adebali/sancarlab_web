Exposure to UV radiation triggers DNA lesions that can lead to skin cancer, the most common type of cancer in the United States. Previous studies in mice have shown that levels of a protein called XPA, involved in repairing UV-induced DNA lesions, waxes and wanes with the time of day. Shobhan Gaddameedhi et al. found that the protein's level and activity in mouse skin cells are at their lowest at 4 AM and their highest at 4PM.
